Q1: I tried out the get price method and got a value of 1. 
    I used the InsertMoney method and added some money inside and then used method getBalance and
I got the amount I put inside
    I inserted a random amount and then used the method printTicket and all the money in the balance was gone
and was sent down to zero.
    
Q2: It would be zero

Q3: When I add a negative amount the amount goes down.
    When I added too much money the amount then went to a negative amount.
    Even after putting in so much money and it going to negative, I did not get my refund.
    When I put 1 and print ticket it still went through
    
Q5: Yes it looks different. The price of the ticket is different.

Q6: public class Student
    public class LabClass
